Pontifical of S. Thomas a Becket.

Now iu the Public Lilirary, Douai; MS 94.

This MS is well known, from being described in the 'Voyage
Litteraire of Martene and Durant. It was. originally at
Marchiennes and is traditionally the Pontifical of Archbishop
Becket. 'I'he handwriting of the MS is said to be of the l2th
century, but it is certainly copied from one earlier than the

Conquest. lt almost throughout verbally agrees with
Archbishop Robert’s book and Claud. A. III (Ethelred's

Coronation Office) and with O. 0. Ο. 146, and it has none of
the modifications found in all the l2th century MSS.

In the Consecratio Regis, it has :-

“ hunc famulum tuum ill. quern supplici devotione in regem
Anglorum vel Saxonum pariter eligimus ; ‘’

and:-

“Hic totius regni Anglorum Saxonum ecclesiam deinceps
cum plebibus sibi annexis ita enutriat.‘’ ,
The whole Oorouation form is identical with those earlier
than the accession of Henry 1. It will be found in the

Appendix to this Volume p. 267.
