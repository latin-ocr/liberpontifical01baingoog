‘ XXVIII.

The Pontifical of Olifford Bishop of London 1406-1426.

no. 79.

This magnificent volume, by far the most splendid of all
comprised in this list, was the property of Olifford Bishop of
London whose arms are' emblazoned in the illuminatior

The Pontifical very closely agrees with the previous London

Pontifical, Lansdowne MS. 451, (above no. xxvi) hut in the κ

profession of obedience the Bishop of London is not named.
Like that Manuscript it hus duplicate Forms of Offices.
Consecratio Pontificum (I) secundum Romanam Ecclesiam.
