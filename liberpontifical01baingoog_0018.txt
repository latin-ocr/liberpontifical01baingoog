eighth century, except some Masses found in the Sacramentary
attributed by Pamelius to Alcuin.

Another circumstance seems to point to an early date for ’

this part of the Volume. ln the Ohoral parts of the Mass
noted in the margin, only 4 Sequences are given, viz.

Feria ii. in Albis3 Caelica resonent.

Feriaiii. Mater Sequentiarum. ’

Feria iv. Olaris vocibus.

Feriavi. - Lyra.
⁸ If this is compared to the very full list of Proses or
Sequences in the Bodleian MS 775, written in the reign of
Ethelred A. D. 994-1017, and the known popularity of
Sequences in England is considered, the time when 4

Sequences in Baster week vformed the whole list, must be
put a long way back. These Sequences, with the days on¹

which they were sung, will be found in the App. to the 2nd
Volume of the York Missal3 Surtees S'oc. vol. lx. p. 283. *
In folio 257 ol the MS occurs in a Litany :—
Ut regern Anglorum et exercitus ejus conservare digneris;
In folio 267, in another Litany, occurs what appears to be

an unique expression :-

Ut reges nostros et exercitus eorum conservare digneris.
which, if not merely a copy from some foreign Litany, may ι
point to a time when the “Sceptra Saxonum, Merciorum,
Nordanchymbrorum,” to use the words of the Coronation
Office of Charles V. of Frauce (Br. Mus. Cotton MSS Tib.
B. viii.) had not yet been united.

Mr Westwood in his Fac-similes of Miniatures of Anglo·
Saron and lrish MSS, gives a long account of the Ms with
fac-similes. He describes'the writing as a pure Caroline
minuscule, with plain capitals about an inoh thigh. Four

leaves of the Canon of the Mass are beautifully ornamented ,

* Ihave there wrongly spoken oi this Volume in the Bodleian, as the only
known English Troper. Mr Bradshaw has told me of three others, (l)
Saec. xia Winohester Book in Corpus Christi Library, Cambridge; (2) Seeo.
xii. in the British Museum; and (3) Saec. xiii-xiv. in the Cambridge
University Library, which once belonged to S. Patriek’s in Dnblin.
