xiv Pontificula of English and Scotoh Uae. Ι

in the Franco-Sason style of the time of Oharles the Bald‚

who reigned till A. D. 877.

The services in the Pontifical part of the Sacramentary
have generally no rubries or very short ones. They agree
with the simplest and earliest Forms. They are simplet·
even than those in Egbert3 but it is to be remembered, that
this is not properly a Pontifioal.

Of the Masses contained in this part ot the volume, I have
found 250 in the Sacramentaries edited by Muratori‚ viz.
234 in the Gregorian 20 in the Gelasian, and 1 in the Leonine.
of the remainder‚ 16 occur in the Sacramentary edited by
Menard, and 6 in the Sacramentary ot Alcuin as edited by
Pamelius; 4 in other Sacramentaries in the same volume; 4
are mixed, and 171 have as yet been unable to find in any

early Collection.
of the Messes in the Gregorian Sacramentary of Muratori‚

all but 19 are in Leofric. Of the other Offices in the MS,
some are wholly from the Gelasian, and one or two much
nearer to the Leonine than to the Gelasian or Gregorian.

It should be added, that the book commences, with the
Oanon ot the Mass, that it has in the margin the Epistles and
Gospels of each day, with the variables of the Mass for the
choir3 all in the original hand.

On the covering¹ folio is written :—

“ Hunc missalem Leofricus episcopus dat Ecclesiae sancti
Petri apostoli in Exonia ad utilitatem successorum suorum.
Si quis illum inde abstulerit, aeternae subjaceat maledictioni.
Fiat, fiat. ’ Oonfirma hoc, Deus, quod operatus es in nobis.”

A fac-simile of some of the leaves is given by Mr Westwood.

Very little has hitherto been printed from this Sacramentary.
The hidding prayer and a few extracta by Dr ltock3 the form
tor the consecration of a king and a collation of some Offices
by Mr Maskell.

Some manumissions are printed from fol. I. of this MS.
