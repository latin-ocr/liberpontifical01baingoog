Found in the Westminster Pontifioal, the supposed Linooln
Ms in the Cambridge University Library (Mm. iii. 21),
Laoy’s Pontifioal, and MS Lansdowne 451.

Of these, the Linooln MS appears, by the additional matter
it contains, to be the latest.

The Wostminster Pontifioal gives this as the form used
for Edward ll. .

This form does not vary from the previous in ihe unction
und list of things delivered.

Itis printed in Mr Maskell’s “ Monumenta Ritualia.”

This is found in the “Liber Regalis '’ and Bishop Olifford's
Pontifioal. It was the form used for Richard II.

The Liber Regalis has been printed in a volume presented
by Lord Beauohamp to the Roxburghe Olub and a full collation
of it is given by Mr Maskell in the “ Monumenta Ritualia.’¹

The Ooventry and Bangor books, Archbishop Ohiohele's
and Arohbishop Bainbridge's Pontifioals, as well as MS
Tanner 5, have no Coronation Offioe.
