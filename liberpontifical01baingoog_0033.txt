Its 0011191110 010 0 great medley‚ and it 10 1119 work of
more than one scribe. It contains homilies in Anglo-
Saxon3 sermons in Latin on various matters; capitula
of (1011110110, particularly 101. 201 “ Capitula concilii apud
r Wintoniam celebrati,” printed in wilkins, 1. 305, from· this
MS, where it is put under the year 1076. Α100, “ Poenitentis

’ placed by W ilkins in 1076, but which probably should rather
bo put in 1010. Now Hermon was Bishop of Salisbury only
. from 1075 to 1078. 00010001101111078101099. Considering ¹
these dates and the ritual importance 01 1119 MS. I am fully
persuaded that so far 01 least as the Pontifical Offices go, it
was written for and under the direction 01 Bishop Osmund.

The Offices in this MS belonging to the Pontifical‚ 00110101
01 three portione :—

1. Minor Benedictions which are to be found in almost all
the older Pontifioals or Sacramentaries.

2. Forms 101 Holy Thursday‚ Good Friday, Easter Eve,
relic chests, altar tabernacle, for the Consecration 01 119110,
and for Synods‚ Ember days, and a few minor matters.
These 019 verbally from the Ordo ¹Romanus printed by
Hittorp.

3. Forms for the Benediction 01 Α1111010, Ν11110, Widows‚
Abbesses, and Ordinationsof Olergy3 these verballycorrespond
witht the Formo of the 12 th 110011 ury Pontifioals, and probably
may be reasonably ttbough tthe work of Bishop Osniund
himself.
