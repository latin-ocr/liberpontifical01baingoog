Liber Pontificalis Gemmetibblisis.

This MS is now number 362 in the Public Librury of
Rouen, t'o which ploce it wau brought from J umidges.

A full description of it is given in the Archaeologiu, vol. xxv.
by Mr Guge. lt will be sufficient here to say, that the initials
ere pluiu in coloure3 that no gold iu used; the rubrics ure
often in alternate lines of red, green, und blue; there ure
two illuminatione, both of which ure given in the Archaeologiu,
with a foc-simile of the text.

It iu u MS. written in England, which for u time belonged
to the Bishop of Alet in Brittany. At fol. 183 is a general
form of excommunication to be pronounced by the Biehop
Lanaletensis monasterii.

The English saints referred to in the Lituniee are, S.
Birinuu, S. ErconwoM, und S. Outhbert. The name of S.
Columbon is blso found. From the illumination un argument
is druwn by Mr (iuge, that the MS is earlier than 950,
which is,1 think, correct. It seems from the Coronation
Office,.fr0m those for the Consecrution of Bishops, of Oilu
und Chrism, to be clearly earlier than Dunstan‘u Pontificul.
The Coronation Office is identicul with thot in the Pontifical
of Egbert, and has the helmet for the crown. The Form
for Consecruting Oil is, us in Egbert und Leofric, from un
Ordo Romanus.

Mr Gugo, however, finds u difficulty in fixing the date of
the MS to the first half of the tenth century, from the Form ⁴
for the Benediction of tepere on the Purifieution being found
