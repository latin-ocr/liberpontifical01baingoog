Pontifical of Ohichelc Archbishop of Canterbury1414—1443.
now in Trinity College Library, Cambridge.

In the form for Degrading an heretical (herli, we have

fol. 214. ‘⁶ copia vero hujusmodi sententiae sequitur et talis ⁸
vel consimilis esse potest.‘’
ι “ In Dei nomine Amen. Nos Henricus permissione divina
Cantuariensis Archiepiscopus, totius Angliae Primus, &03¹ and
so elsewhere in the same Office and in that for the henediction
of Orutched Friars.

It isa thick Volume, of resalvari ⁸musical notes, very
little ornament and not a handsome book.

lt contains Peckham’s Benedictions as well as the ordinary
set, and some Offices peculiar to this Ms, as the Form for
profession of Orutched Priore, and that for admission of Nuns
and Friars of the order of S. Bridget.

These both lived in the same monastery, now Sion Oollege,
founded in 1414. and the only English House of the order.

It also has duplicate forms in one instance.

Consecratio Crucis (1) in forma curiae Romanae.

(2) admodum Angliae.

There are very long Offices for Enclosing Archontes, both -
male and female3 and very full and various forms for
admissione into Monastic orders.

It gives the Exeter Rubrio on Oolours, as well as the Sarum.

The Use of Sarum is constantly referred to, and there are
repeated notices of the variatione between it and the Roman
Use.

ln the Appendix will be found the confirmation Service as
given in this MS, (which provides for two points not elsewhere
noticed, Confirmation on a journey and hypothetical Con-
firmation,) and the office for laying the Foundation Stone of a
Ohurch.

The statement in the old Catalogus Generalis that this ’
vas a Pontifical of the time of Philip and Many, appears to
have been founded on nothing better than the title of the

mas “Pro Rege et Regina.''
