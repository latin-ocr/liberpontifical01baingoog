From this it has been supposed that these books were
written for Bishops of Ely; the Cathedral of Ely being
dedicated to S. AEtheldrytha, and Sexburga and Wihtburga
being her sisters and Eormenhilda closely connected with her.

service, the Litany printed from the Ordo Romanus⁴ in the
Appendix to this volume, in au abridged and general form,
the King, Quaen and Archbishop not being specially named.

This book, of which only one or two leaves are missing,
belonged in 1348 to the Cathedral of Hereford, as is seen
from a list of contenta on the outside folio. There are a
good many marginal alteratione, all of the xivth Century.

The only internal evidence as to locality is common to this
book and all the xiith Centurybooks in this list, namely
that it was written for the holder of a See in the Province ,of
Canterbury, from the Decretum &a de eleeto Episcopo.

“ Venerando sancta Cantuariensis Ecclesiae Metropolitauo
N. clerus et populus Ecclesiae ill. debitam subjectionem

aud in the Examinatio Episcopi.

[uter. Vis Sanctae Dorobernensi Ecclesia fidem et sub-
jectionem per omnia exhiheret

There are some leaves inserted iu the earlier partof the
MS, containing in a hand of the xivth Century the Prefaees
aud the Canon of the Mass (without rubrica.) The rubries
of the Prefaces correspond to those of the York Missal, and
not to those of the Sarum or Hereford.
