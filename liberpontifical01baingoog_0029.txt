The Office for blessing Palms 1 cannot find elsewhere. It
may be an insertion of Leofric, though in the midst of
extracta from the Ordines Romani. Itis immediately pre-

ceded by the words, “Sabbato ante Palmae Domnus Papa
eleemosynam dat,’' which are found in the Ordo printed hy
Hittorp, * on which see the account which follows of Vitell.
Elx'lie remaining two Offices, those ior Holy 'I'hursday and

Cotton MSS. Vitellius E. xii. British Museum.

This MS is one of the volumen of the Cotton Library that
suffered from the fire in 1731. It is now only a collection of
fragments which are in great disorder.

Part of the volume, from llo-160, consiste of fragments,
the remains of au Ordo Romanus, to which are appended the
Benedictions of the images of S. Peter and S. Swithin, some
prayers, addresses in the Offices for the Sicln and a Litany.

This Ordo Romanus is identical with one printed by
flittorp iu his “ de Divinis Catholicae Ecclesiae 0ffioiis.”

⁴* An account of this Ordo printed by Hittorp will be found in the
'tubingen Theological Quarterly for 1862 in an article by Dr Meckel
pp. 51-53.

lt has been conjectured by some, but on very questionable grounds, that
the Ordo in its present state came irom the hands of Beruoldus of constance.
Dr Rock thinks that perhaps it was adopted to the Gologne use. Iam
indebted for this note as well ns ior much else, to Mr h. Bishop of Faber,
who adds his opinion that the MS described by Morinns de adimantus,
p. 257 of tho lst paginati0n‚ isan earlier and u simplet form of tho same
Ordo.
