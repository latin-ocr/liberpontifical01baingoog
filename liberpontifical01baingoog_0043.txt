The order for Consecration of Nuns printed by Mr Maskell
Mon. Rit. vol. 2. 307. is a translation of the form iu this

This is a very fine folio MS, perfect, with illuminatione

and some curicus pictores.

, It has been called from entrieS, the Evesham, and therefore

an Abbatial Pontifical, and from the rubrio on Colours fol.
18. 19. where Ecclesia nostra Exon. is named, ithus been
· assigned to Eneter. .

It may have belonged to Evesham after the death cf its
owner, but it is in no sense an Abbatial Pontifical. And the
expression in the rubric on Colours proves nothing. This “
has been taken from some Exeter book and inserted without
alteration. lt is found also in Archbishop Chichele's
Pontifical, (No xxviii. infra) and 0000 79, (No xxvii.)
totidem verbio.

The MS. was written fora Bishop of London, and would
refer only to the Use of S. Paule, so far as it referred to any
special Usc at all. .

The Widows’ profession fol. 75 is “Ego N. vidua, nou
conjugata, promitto et voveo Decet beatae Mariae et sanctis
omnibus in praesentia vestra, Reverende iu Christo pater
Domine N. Londinensis Episcope, propositum castitatis
vidualis perpetuae juxta regulum beati Pauli apostoli. In
nomine Putris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.'’

The volume also agrees throughout very closely with

0000. 79, the Pontifical of Olifford Bishop of London,
