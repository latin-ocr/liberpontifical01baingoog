. The volume consistsof three distinct parts.

First‚ the original Secremmtnry, which Ι hove referred to
as Leofric A. This corresponds very closely with the
Gregorian Sacramentory edited by Muratori; more particularly
with his (lodex Othobonianus.

Secoudly‚ the Calendor und Tables, which seem to be of a .
later dote than the Sacramentary. The Tables commence

A. D. 969. (Dr Rock und Mr Westwood.)
“ Thirdly, come additions to the old Sacramentum, not all in
one hund, of which for the larger portion at any rate were

after. This is referred to os Leotiic Band described below

Some Scints' days in the Calendar hove led Dr Roch to
, suppose that the MS may huve been written, or at leost used,

909-91-1, ond Eadulf ll. Bishop of Devonshire (Crediton)
A. D. 931 ; (Le N eve’s Fusti3 Hardy.)

The date of the original Sacramenlory is not so clear.

In the saints invoked in the Litany‚ the latest are, as in
Egbert‚ S. Cuthbert ond S. Guthls03 the last early in the
eighth century. S. Swithiu, saec. ix, ond S. Dunstan‚ saec. x,
are not nomed.

The hondwriting of this port of the Volume is thought by
