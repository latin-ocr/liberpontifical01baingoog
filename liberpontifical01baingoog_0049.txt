This 1s the Pont ifioal of Archbishop Bainbridge printed
in the present volume.

'l'o the above is to be §xivg-MS in the Library of the

. ' Marquis of Bath at Longleat, which bas been shown me

by Mr Bradshaw, the Librarian of the University of
Cambridge, but too late to notice in its proper place.

The volume is made up of pieces of two or three Pontificals
of the xiiith and xivth centurias. It contains two forms for
the Dedication of a Ohurch‚ differing from each other3 a '
Benedictional, Offiees for Ordination‚ for the consecration of
Nuus, Abbots and Abbesses, and for the Special Days.
There is nothing to indicate for what Bisbops or Sees the
MSS bound together in this volume were written.
