Stin, there is in Egbert a single prayer, “Benedictio
luminis in Purificatione sanctae Mariae,’' and the complete
Office as given in the J umieges Pontifical, is found identically
in Leofri03 it is added, though by a later hand, to the MS in -
Dunstau3 itis also found in the Pontificals numbered in this
¹ list, 4 and 7 and described below. As it seems that the
latest date for the Office in Leofric is 969, Ι should rather
infer the date of the Office from that of the MS, as probable ’
on other grounds, than conversely3 at least to the extent I
have done3 and, as it has been suggested tc me, there is no
reason why it may not have been used in Eugland many years
before it was adopted on the Continent.

Several Offices have been printed from this MS.

Ordo dedicationis ecclesiae et cimiterii, iu the Archaeologia,
A. D. 1834.

Qualiter debeant suscipere poenitentem.

Ordo reconciliationis altaris vel ecclesiae.

Ordinatio ad vii. ordines.

Benedictio clei infirmorum.

Exercismus contra daemonium.

Benedictio scrinii vel areae.

Ordo ad ungendos infirmos.

Benedictio virginum.

Benedictio monachorum.

All these are in Martene‚ as well as the Form cf Excom-

municaticn by the Bishop of Alet.
