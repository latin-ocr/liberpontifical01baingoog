Pontificals of Eaplc'sh aad Scotch Uoc. xvii

IV.

MS 146 Oorpus Christi Oollege, Cambridge3 fol. 61-329.

This Pontifical is bound up with some other pontifical
Offices, described below number xiii, which belonged to
Sampson Bishop of Worcester3 iu whose time the whole may
have formed a single book.

This part of the volume appears to be a tenth century
manuscript. The initial letters are very plain. There are
no illuminations.

In the hand-writing‚ and the alternate red and green lines
of the rubrius, and in the contractione, it very closely cor-
responds with the J umieges MS just described.

The Benedictional which forms partos the volume, must
be ol a much later date, as one of the Benedictions is for
the translation of S. AEthelwold.

The following Benediction would show this part to be a
Winchester book, and also bears upon the question of its
date :-

“Benedictio iu QuintaFeriade Sanctis in Ecclesia Wentana
quiescentibus.

“ Deus, qui sanctam loci istius ecclesiam pio labore beati
Birini episcopi olim consecratam, meritis sancti confessoris
tui antistitis Swithuni moderno tempore dignatus es multiplici
miraculorum privilegio glorificare, &c.''

The English saints occurring in the Benedictional, are
AElphege‚ cuthbert, Augustino, theldreda, and Swithiu,
AEthelwold; of the two last there are Benedictious ior the
Dies natalis and the Dies translationis.

In the form for Ordeal there are Anglo-Saxon versions
of the adjurations. Ἴ

The volume is noticed Wanley, Hickes‘ Thesaurus, p. 106.
