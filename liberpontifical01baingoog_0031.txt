lt will be seen that two of the Offices in Leofric B and
a considerable portion of Tiberius O lto be next described,
are copied from this Ordo printed by Hittorp, which therefore
is of great importance, if it is indeed the original document
to which were due the changes in the Pontifical Services
which are found between the l2th century books and
those hitherto described with the exception of Leofric B.
There is a very marked change in ceremonial‚ in the
wording of rubrics, and in the prayers‚ between the first
nine MSS above described, and those which follow. ln this
volume, in Leofric B, and partly in Tiberius O 1, we have the
Offices found in this Ordo with scarcely a verbal change.
Afterwards‚ partly in Tiberius 0 1 and wholly in the 12th

· century and later Pontificals, the Offioes are formed by

combinatiou of those in the older Anglo-Saxon Pontificals,
and those in this Ordo.

I am inclined to believe that these Forms were introduced
into England by Leofric: and that the second change, that to
Forms based partly on this Ordo and partly on the 'older
Rituals‚ was due to Bishop Osmund. There is an extreme
similarity between all the l2th century books, which certainly
points to some one original.

This Ordo Romanus is supposed by Hittorp to have been
sent into France by Pope Stephen in the reign of Pepin or
Charlemagne.

The appended Forms of Consecration of Images of S. Peter
and S. Swithin, which appear to have originally formed part
of the same volume though written possibly by another
scribe, show this volume to have been a Winchester book,
that Cathedral having been dedicated originally to S. Mary
aml S. Peter, afterwards also to S. Swithin.

The Litany with which the MS. concludes, will be found
