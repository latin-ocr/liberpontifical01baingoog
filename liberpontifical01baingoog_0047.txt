xlii Pontificaia of English and Scotch Uoc

The Pontifical of Lacy Bishop of Exeter, circa 1420. now
in the Library of the ,Dean and Chapter of Exeter.

This was published by the late Mr Ralph Barnes in 1847.
and can still be had, Ι believe, at Stewart’s‚ King William
Street, Strand.

Lacy was'consecrated Bishop of Hereford in 1417 and
translated to Exeter in 1420. ,

The proof of ownership is given ou the 2nd folio; “Hunc
Librum Pontificalem dederunt executores bonae memoria
Edmuhdi Lacy nuper dum vixit Exoniensis Episcopi, de bonis
ejusdem Ecclesiae cathedralis Exoniensis ibidem remansurum

&c.”

XXXI.

Bodleian Library, MS. Tanner 5. saec. xiv. ineunt.

This is endorsed hy a late hand, as a Sarum Pontifical, but
there is no evidence whatever that it belonged toa Bishop
of . Salisbury. It is almost identical in all the strictly
Pontifical Offices with Lacy’s, just described, but ⁴it has
neither the Coronation Office nor the Office for Consecration
of Chrism secundum Usum Sarum. Still, the two Mss
did not belong to successive holders of the same See, as
is¹ plain from the considerable variations betweenssthem in the
Manual Offices, especially those for Baptism and Matrimony.

British Museum, additional MSS. 6157. saec. xv.

This fragment consisting of 146 leaves, is exceedingly similar
in writing to Archbishop Ohichele’s Pontifical and is also for
¹an Archbishop of Canterbury. Its coutents are nearly
identical with the very peculiar Offices iu Archbishop
Chichele's book, as far as they go.
