’ This volume, which is magnificently written, though
without ornamented capitale or illuminations, was originally
written for some Suffragan of the Province of (lanterbury.
This appears from the Decretum de Electo Episcopo, and the
Examinatio Episcopi, wherein it agrees with the Mago. Ooll.
MS. above described (no. xviii.) It became afterwards the
property ol a Bishop of Glasgow, as is shown, just as in the
case of the Exeter book, by the Abbot's profession, the name
ol the original Diooese having been erased and that of
(ilasgow inserted in a hand of the same period.

“Vis sanctae Ecclesia (ilasguensi canonicam per omnia
subjectionem exhibere.”

The only variations from the Hereford and Duhlin Books‚

Ι of any note are in the Forms for Consecration of Nuus.

In the middle of this volume is bound up the Coronation
Ollice for Oharles V. of France‚ on which see the note in
Mashell Menum. Rit. iii.. p. 14. Ι will only add that the
expression “ Ut regale solium, videlicet Saxonum, Merciorum,
Nordanehimhrorum sceptra non deserat,'' does not occur in
any known English Pontifical.

Paris, National Library, MS. Lat. 1218. Saec. xiii.

This was the Pontifical of David de Burnham Archbishop
ol‘ S. Andrews. ⁴ ,

It is described in the printed Catalogue merely as
“ Pontificale Anglicanum,” and its identification is due to the
sagacity of M. Delisle‚ now the Administrateur Generul of
that noble Library, who observed at the beginning u list of
churches consecrated or reconciled by the Scottish primate.
Itis a small quarto, well and eorrectly written, and with

,, musical notation.
