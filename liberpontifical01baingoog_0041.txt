xxxvi Pontificola of Eupliah aad Scotct Uim.¹

The volume hasbeen badly bound, many of· the ornameuted
and illuminated letters having been cut that the edges of
the volume might be gilt. '

Besides some at the beginning, two leaves are lost from
the body of the book; the first leaf of the (lanon, and in the
Benedictional the folio containing from Dom. xv. to Dom. xx.
post Pentecosten. The centre of the larger illuminated
letters has been inmost cases cut out. Therubrics are in many
places illegible. All the Choral parts have musical notation.

This Manuscript contains all the ordinary Pontifical Ser-
viceS‚ the Offices for Special Days and also those usually
found in the Manual.

The chief interest attaching to' this MS arises from the
expectation that it might enable us to determine the “Une of
Bougor. Most of the Offices in this book are collated by
Mr Maskell in his Monumenta Ritualia‚ but it must be
remembered that the Ordinary and Canon of the Mass for
the Bangor Use as given in the text of his ‘⁴ Aneient Liturgy
of the (lhurch of England,” are not from this volume but
from a Missal, once belonging to Oswestry. Ι will only
say here, that the Ordinary and Canon of the Mass in this
Pontifical are singularly close to the Sarum form3 and where
this Volumeand the Coventry Pontifical (No. xxi.) give forms
for the same Pontifical Obice, there is the closest similarity
between them. The Offices for Orders‚ ad Clerioum faciendum,
aud Benedictio Viduae are identical in the two MSS, and that
for the Consecratio Ecclesiae very nearly so.

In the Benedictional are found forms for S. Francis (Day⁴
and Translation) S. Dominic, S. Clair, and S. Bernard.

The Profession of a Nun is as follows :-

Ego soror N. promitto stabilitatem meam et couversionem
luorum meorum et obedientiam secuudum regulam S. Benedicti
corum Deo et sanctis ejus, in hoc monasterio quod est con·
structum iu honore Dei et sauctae Etheldredoe in praesentia
domui N. Episcopi et domnae N. Abbatissae.
