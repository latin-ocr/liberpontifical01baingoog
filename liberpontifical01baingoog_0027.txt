xxii Pontificalsof English aad Scotch Ure.

“Orodis sanctam Oatholicam et Apostolicam unam esse
veram Ecclesiam &c.”
Ι we have in the margin :-

“Articulus hic de Transuhstantiatione et articulus de
corporali praesentia sauguinis in novo Pontificali Anglico
inseruntur3 et in Pontifioali Romano hi articuli praedicti non

Ι habentur.”

The MS appears to have been written for au Arcbbishop
of Oanterbury, and probably in the reign of Edward the

- Confessor.

Tho profession of the Bishop is, to be “obediens sancta ·
Dorobernensi ecclesiae.”

Itis a very handsome volume, with little ornament but
very well written in one haud throughout.

The English saints named iu the Litanies are, 'AElphega
Dunstan, Swithin, Outhbert, Guthlao, AEtheldrytha‚ Mildrytha,
Edward. . ·

The expressions in the ‘⁶ Consecratio Regis ’³ are :-

“ in regem Anglorum vel Saxonum ; ’‘

“ totius regni cinglo-Saxonum ; ''

“ Anglorum vel Saxonum.’'

The words “Anglicus'’ and “Anglo-Saxonicus‚” occur
perpetually in the Antiphone and Prayers in this Office.

las chief characteristics are, the great lengthening of all
the Offioes by the addition of long new prayers and by insertione
in the old prayers3 by the introductiou of very frequent
references to the intercession of Saints, far beyond any other
Pontifical.

The only Office in which this MS clearly follows earlier
MSS is that for Ordeals with which it concludes.

Several of the shorter Forms do not occur in any other

English Pontifical, as that ‘⁸ ad ordinandum Decanum,” which
consists of two prayers nearly identical with those given
in Martene (de Rit. 2. 1 Ordo vi.) as a form for the Benediction
of an Abbot, from aRheims manuscript. ⁵
Nasmyth’s (latalogue says of this MS :-
“Codex membranaceum forma quadrata, in folio, ante
conquisitionem Angue, ut videtur, scriptus.''
