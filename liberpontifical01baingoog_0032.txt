in the appendix to this volume. It has musical notes. The
names of King William‚ Queen Matilda‚ Pope Alexander and
Archbishop Aldred will be found in the Litany. The Litany
therefore, must have been written between the years 1067-
1070 when Alexander was Pope and Aldred was the only
Archbishop acknowledged by the King‚ and who therefore, ¹
is prayed for as the Archbishop of the realm and not merely
as Archbishop of a province.

Having regard to the character of this Litany‚ and the
circumstance that it is found in a generalised and slightly
modified form in the Ely Pontifical in the library of Trinity
College, described below, in immediate connection with the
Coronation Obice, and lastly‚ to the prominence given in it to
Matilda,I am led to think that it is the Litany sung at the
coronation of Matilda by Archbishop Aldred in 1068.

At the conclusion of the Form for consecrating a boll, is
the rubrio, not found in Hittorp :-

“Tunc sub trina infusione aquae sancta, impone ci nomen,
si velis.’'

With this may be compared the concluding rubrio ofthc
Office in the Sarum Manual :5—

“Deinde aspergatur aqua benedict-a, et totus populus
praesens. Etimponatursibinomenpersacerdotem,apponendo
manum supra et simul imponunt patrini et matrinae. Et post
presbyterum nominapt suum (i. e. campana) nomen co-
operiendo cloccam linthe0.”
